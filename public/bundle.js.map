Luckily building React components is familiar to me, but much was changed since Gatsby uses \n                templates, does not give direct access to React Router, and uses a different directory structure with some new files. \n                It also has a different ways of setting up the default html file. I read through the Github repo, looked at some examples, \n                added materialize.css to help with styling, then I was up and running pretty quickly.
